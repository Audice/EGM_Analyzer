# EGM_Analyzer
The application is designed for the analysis of electrograms using artificial intelligence. In particular, for segmenting the signal using neural network models and localizing myocardial activation points. The application has an option for data labeling and forming a dataset for training artificial intelligence models.

An example of an electrogram signal to test the program's functionality: https://disk.yandex.ru/d/R5e9RipCZiLzFg
